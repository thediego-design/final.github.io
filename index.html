                Do not use FlibberFlabber if you have recently eaten a banana. This could interfere with the cosmic balance.

                    If you come up with a great idea while using FlibberFlabber™, you agree to share it with the moon. No one else is allowed to steal your ideas, unless they're wearing a polka-dotted hat.

                    <li>Termination</li>FlibberFlabber may terminate your access if you refuse to participate in our weekly "Invisible Hat Parade."
                    Upon termination, you must return all clouds you have borrowed from FlibberFlabber™ during your usage period. Failure to do so will result in an angry flock of invisible ducks appearing at your door.

                    <li>Dispute Resolution</li>Any disputes will be settled by a rock-paper-scissors competition between you and a member of our customer service team (who may or may not be an actual human).
                    If rock-paper-scissors doesn't resolve the issue, we will resort to an intense game of hopscotch on a trampoline.
